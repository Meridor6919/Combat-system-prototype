It is also a good programming exercise as it involes interesting design decisions and c++ specific features.

Current state of project
========
Currently project fulfills all points and therefore further development will be postponed until new ideas arrise.
It's sole purpose is to test combat system and because of that I won't add skills, effects etc. that don't bring fresh and intresting ideas.
